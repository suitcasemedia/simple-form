* In terminal window, use Create React App to scaffold out the front-end

    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

* Back end:
To run the back end you will need an instance of MongoDb running on your local machine.
    - `cd backend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`


* Testing the back end:
    - `cd backend`
    - `npm test`
   The backend tests are implemented with Mocha and Chai. 
   They test http requests on the Express server.
